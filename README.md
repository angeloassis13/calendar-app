# Calendar App

This README provides an overview of a react app designed for a make up artist to calculate invoicing.

The backend for this app is available at [Google Calendar integration API](https://github.com/angeloassis13/google-calendar-api).

## Running the application

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Next steps

The app is already functional, but it would be better with some improvements, like:

- New view for prices configuration
- Structure and organize the code
- Create components for each part of view
- Create services to handle requests
- Create an util service for common operations (like date formatting and conversion)
- Improve error handling
- Add validations (e.g: Start date cannot be greater than end date)
- Add loading component
- Add unit tests
- Create login page
